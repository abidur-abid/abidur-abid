## 🚀 About Me

🚀I am Abid. I am a Front-End Developer. With a toolbox filled with skills like HTML, CSS, Tailwind CSS, JavaScript, React JS, Firebase, Next JS, and MongoDB, I build web experiences that aim to please both the eye and the user🔥.

My academic background might be in Local Government and Urban Development, but my passion lies in the vast, challenging field of front-end development. Whether it is a portfolio website that uses Recharts JS for an innovative skill display or a dynamic content-driven website for a university department, I have tackled them head-on🔥.

In a world where the internet is an ever-evolving canvas, I pride myself on being a lifelong learner, constantly updating my skill set to stay at the forefront of technology trends🌟.
